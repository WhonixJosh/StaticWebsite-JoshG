    <b><i>Stenopelmatus</i></b> or the Jerusalem Cricket:
    <br>
    <p>The Jerusalem cricket is native to parts of the Southwest United States and Mexico. It is a funny looking cricket that primarly feasts on dead organic matter.It has a big head and larger abdomen.Their highly adapted feet are used for burrowing beneath moist soil to feed on decaying root plants and tubers. each species of Jerusalem cricket produces a different song during mating. This song takes the form of a characteristic drumming in which the insect beats its abdomen against the ground.</p>

    <b><i>Phidippus audax</i></b> or the Jumping Spider:
    <br>
    <p>The Jumping Spider makes up 13% of the spider population species. Their four eyes also give them amazing vision in comparison to all of Spiderdom. They are incredibly agile being able to leap great distances that are upwards of 100x their body length. Their most intersting part of them is how they mate which involves a male and sometimes his own ensmble of performers to "dance" for a female. They are also highly intelligent being able to determine prey, such as flies, from non-threats like humans. This makes them also good pets being referred to as the cats of spiders. </p>

    <b><i>Deinopis</i></b> or the Ogre-faced Spider:
    <br>
    <p>These stick-like and spindly spiders are known for their very unique way of capturing prey. They stretch a web that is shaped like a fisherman's net across their front two legs and drop down on ususpecting prey to wrap them up. They hung upside down from silk threads like Spiderman and use their big eyes which are better than cats and owls at night. These spiders get the name Ogre or Ogre-Faced from the big eyes that that give them an ogre-like appearance. I think Shrek would have been a lot scarier had he looked like this.</p>

    <b><i>Trachelophorus giraffa</i></b> or the Giraffe Weevil:
    <br>
    <p>The Giraffe Weevil is a tiny weevil endmic to Madagascar, making it extremely rare. Males' necks are generally 2 to 3 times bigger than females. Which they use to fight or building nests. Crazy to think that evolution dictates to animals that a long neck on a beetle is the best way to survive. Alas, c'est la vie.</p>
