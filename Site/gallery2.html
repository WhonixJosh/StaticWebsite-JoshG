    <b><i>Bathynomus giganteus</i></b> or the Giant Isopod:
    <br>
    <p>Man, oh, man, talk about a dionsaur. The deep sea giant isopod is quite the crustacean. Often found in the cold waters of the deep Atlatnic, Pacific, and Indian oceans these giant isopods are found deep at least 500 to 7,000 feet below. They can range from 5-30 inches long! Their main diet consists of carcasses that float down to the sea floor but will attack prey such as the poor sea pig below. Their size and lack of natrual predators in the dark, murky depths has allowed them to live so long.</p>

    <b><i>Scotoplanes globosa</i></b> or the Sea Pig:
    <br>
  <p>The sea pig is a species of sea-cucumber that lives in the deep-sea in large groups of ~30. These ggroups are called trawls. The sea pig is often subject to parasites as they move along the ocean floor. They are propelled along by releasing and intaking water into their limbs. At such low depths the sea pigs subsist off of marine snow which is the droppings and organic matter of the marine life above them. The life of a sea pig is a harsh and rather boring one, but are soo cool to me as they look like little ghosts whose intestens are always exposed.</p>

    <b><i>Odontodactylus scyllarus</i></b> or the Mantis Shrimp:
    <br>
  <p>If the giant isopod seemed like a mean crustacean then the mantis shrimp makes them seem cordial. This shrimp seems to always be mad at something, and has the power to back up that attitude. Most are around 4-5 inches in length, but don't let that size fool you.These shrimp are heaveweight champs and are knockout artists. Their eyes are possibly their most interesting feature being able to perceive 15 times the color wavelengths we can. But we have yet to mention the smashing claws. These claws can break open shells of clams, snails, crabs,lobsters, and even other mantis shrimp whom they often fight. These shrimp are like if Mike Tyson was 4inches big and could breathe underwater.</p>

    <b><i>Mola Mola</i></b> or the Ocean Sunfish:
    <br>
    <p>Ah the poor Sunfish. Often found in the pacific oceans the sunfish is a massive fish that averages in length of 5ft and finspan of 8ft. They are incredibly vulnerable as a species coming under threat from natrual predators such as parasites and sea lions. They love to feast on jellyfish, and are known to be incredibly hearty. They can take bites to their brains and still keep going as they rely on their massive size as a defense. Unfortunatley, this is not nearly enough to keep them safe from humans who consume them. Their massive size and pressence in the ocean inspires awe to all those who see them, and it is a shame that they may no longer be with us soon. </p>
